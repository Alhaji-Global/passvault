# Passvault 
Passvault lets you save passwords securely on your machine and generates new passwords with a given length and parameters for you.
This project is meant for learning the basics of Python.

# Roadmap
How to get there:
1. Create a simple password generator.
2. Build a command line tool wrapper.
3. Extend the generator to manage and store passwords.
4. Encrypt stored passwords.

# Contributing
